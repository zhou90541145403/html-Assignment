            <p>As a professional dancer, I embrace the rigor and grace of movement, dedicating myself to the art of expression through dance. My passion for the stage mirrors my commitment to excellence.</p> 
            <p>Equally, as an avid angler, I find solace and thrill in the quiet dance between fish and fisherman. Teaching others, I imbue them with resilience and optimism, reflecting my approach to both work and life.</p>

            <h4>"Life, like dance, requires grace and grit; in teaching as in fishing, patience and joy prevail."- Zhou</h4>
